# VBA-challenge
This repository is for Natasha Elliott's VBA challenge for Monash Data Analytics bootcamp.
This script will generate the total volume, the percentage change, and quarterly change for the tickers within the excel sheet through using conditional formatting, for loops, and if statements.
Additionally, it will calculate the greatest percent increase and decrease, as well as the greatest total volume for all stocks in the quarter.
The loops created will loop through all worksheets as required.
Screenshots for each worksheet are present in the repository.
